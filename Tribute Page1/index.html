                <h2>The God Of Cricket</h2>
                <p><b>Though everyone names Sachin Tendulkar as the “God of Cricket”</b> many don’t know the real reason behind this. The legendary Indian cricketer took up cricket at the age of eleven.
                 On 14 November 1987, the 14-year-old Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, India’s premier domestic first-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season.
                 In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other English countries.
                 Making a century or a double century in ODI and Test may look easier to this generation of players. But during Sachin’s young cricketing carrier he played against many legendary bowlers in a tough turf condition.
                 Eventually, the God of cricket Sachin Tendulkar also called as “Master Blaster”, and “Little Master”. Legend himself Brian Lara termed Sachin Tendulkar as “Bradman of modern era”.</p>
